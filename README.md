### What's good? 👋

I'm Jacob, a product leader with 8+ years of experience building companies and products people love.

I've got a weird combination of skills and experiences under my belt.
- When I was 15 my parents gave me $50 that I could keep if I could double it. I made $1,000 that year.
- I have 2 degrees in business (boring, I know).
- I wrote a book and published 3 articles/week for 3 years for an associated blog.
- I helped build a presentation deck for NASA.
- I rose from intern to a Principal and Director at a creative agency in 3 years.
- I directed national commercials for TV, including one shot on the newly released (at the time) iPhone X.
- I designed user interfaces for the largest coffee company in the Gulf South.
- I co-founded a podcast studio and hosted the flagship show, interviewing 100+ movers and shakers.
- I co-founded an event keynoted by the mayor of my city that brought together the most influential people in business, philanthropy, politics and culture to cast vision for the city.
- I co-founded 2 companies.
- I create these super wacky Christmas cards every year with my family. One even popped off on social media and ended up winning an award 🤷🏽‍♂️
